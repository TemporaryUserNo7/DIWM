# DIWM
Code for the paper entitled "Data-Independent Black-Box Watermark and Unforgeable Ownership Proof for Deep Neural Networks"

## Preparation
To train baseline models, you can use the original steps from https://github.com/VainF/Data-Free-Adversarial-Distillation .
Or incorporate them directly into /checkpoint/teacher.
To run DFD, follow the instruction in https://github.com/VainF/Data-Free-Adversarial-Distillation, results are saved in /checkpoint/student .

## Running DIWM
Executing KFWM_XX for the respective task. 

## Requirements:
PyTorch>=1.11
